# VUE AND AJAX ASSIGNMENT (API MASHUP)
# Dungeons and Dragons Top 10 Strongest Boss Monsters

This project showcases a curated list of the top 10 strongest boss monsters in Dungeons and Dragons. We utilized a combination of APIs to gather information about these formidable creatures. Our approach involved:

- **API Mashup**: We developed a custom API mashup using Lumen framework to fetch data from a local MySQL database containing a comprehensive list of monsters.
  
- **Remote API Integration**: Additionally, we incorporated the API from [5e-bits](https://5e-bits.github.io/) to enrich our dataset with detailed information about the monsters.

- **Frontend Development with Vue.js**: To present and manipulate the data dynamically, we employed Vue.js. This enabled us to fetch JSON data and seamlessly update the DOM, ensuring a reactive and engaging user experience.
